Note that you need to register an email to access the site. The following input was used to obtain the example long list:\n",
    "    * Starting wavelength: TKTKTK  $\\text{\\AA}$\n",

Each spectral line has four rows of information in the file: the first row contains the most relevant information for making the mask, but the format is rather unpleasant to use. The line mask has a much more simplistic format that makes it easier to parse and manipulate. Additionally, the line mask calculates the effective Landé factor for each of the lines."

    "The mask tells us the location and depth of all lines in a spectrum but does not tell us about the shape of the lines of the spectrum as a whole. We need a mask to help us weigh each spectral line in the spectrum so that they can be averaged together in an LSD. Given a spectrum and a mask, we can deconvolve the spectrum with the mask to generate an LSD profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a mask we will use the `make_mask` function. The function has the following inputs:\n",
    "* lineListFile - name of the file containing the line list\n",
    "* maskFile - name of the file to write the output mask to\n",
    "* depthCutoff - only include lines in the mask that are deeper than this value\n",
    "* wlStart - optional, use only lines with wavelengths above this\n",
    "* wlEnd - optional, use only lines with wavelengths below this\n",
    "* landeStart - optional, use only lines with effective Lande factors above this\n",
    "* landeEnd - optional, use only lines with effective Lande factors below this\n",
    "* elementsUsed - optional, list of elements to include in the mask creation\n",
    "* elementsExclude - optional, list of elements to exlude from the mask creation\n",
    "* atomsOnly - only include atomic lines (no molecular lines and no H-lines)\n",
    "* includeNoLande - include lines in the mask even if they don't have an effective Lande factor given\n",
    "* DefaultLande - the value for the effective Lande factor to use in the case that a line has no listed effective Lande factor \n",
    "\n",
    "For most cases you will only use the top three inputs and `atomsOnly`. Note that the hydrogen lines are automatically exluded when `atomsOnly` is `True`. This is done since the hydrogen lines have different shape than all the other lines in the spectrum due to their broad wings. The input line list is a VALD line list file and is obtained from the VALD website. More details about VALD is given in `OneObservationFlow_Tutorial.ipynb`. The `make_mask` function will automatically attempt to calculate the effective Lande factor for lines where it is not given, however if one is unable to be calculated it will be excluded if `includeNoLande` is `False` or it will equal `DefaultLande` if `includeNoLande` is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example case used below, we are using all atomic lines in the line list except ones without effective Lande factors. We also remove all lines with a depth smaller than the `depthCutoff` of 0.02. The Hydrogen lines are also removed by default, however these lines have very broad wings that lead to blending with nearby lines. As a result, we will need to remove nearby blended lines in the next subsection.\n"
