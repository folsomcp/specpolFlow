    "The plots these functions generate are pretty good, particularly for a quick look.  However, for more advanced plots you may wish to make your own plots from scratch.  For plotting line lists, there are wide variety of approaches one can use, and you may wish to consider using alternative packages such as `lineid_plot` (see their [webpage](https://lineid-plot.readthedocs.io/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/phn/lineid_plot/)).\n",
