    "\n",
    "The equivalent width (EW) of a line is a useful characteristic for describing the strength of a spectral feature. EWs have specific use-cases in the study of different objects; for example, [the EW of the Balmer alpha transition in T Tauri stars is used to classify them as being classical or weak-lined](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9783527618675).\n",

    "$$EW = \\sum \\frac{F_c - F_\\lambda}{F_c} d\\lambda,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $F_c$ is the continuum, $F_\\lambda$ is the line profile, and $d\\lambda$ is the sampling. In this code, the EW and it's uncertainty is reported in units of the `lambda0` you input."
